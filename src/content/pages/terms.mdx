- **Traditional Herbs** wildcrafted from Olancho and La Mosquitia

### Natural Product Variability

While we strive to provide accurate product descriptions, images, and information, **natural products may vary** in appearance, color, aroma, texture, and other characteristics due to:

- Origin-specific factors (soil, climate, ecosystem)

Such variations are inherent to authentic, unrefined ethnobotanical products and **do not constitute defects or grounds for return** unless the product is damaged or significantly misrepresented.

Product information is provided for **educational and commercial purposes only** and does not constitute medical, therapeutic, or health advice.

---

## 3. Traditional Use and No Medical Claims

### No Medical Claims

**Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.**

### Refund Processing

Approved refunds are processed within **5-7 business days** after returned items are received and inspected. Refunds are issued to the original payment method or as store credit, depending on your preference and payment method used.

**Shipping fees are generally non-refundable** unless the issue was caused by Forestal MT (wrong item, verified defect, or confirmed shipping damage).
