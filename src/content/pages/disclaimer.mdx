## Traditional Use and Cultural Context

References to traditional uses, ancestral practices, cultural knowledge, or historical applications of ethnobotanical products are provided solely as cultural and educational context.

Such references do not constitute medical, therapeutic, nutritional, or health advice, nor are they intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Our products are based on traditional uses and ethnobotanical knowledge from indigenous communities in Honduras. The information provided on our website reflects historical and traditional applications of these natural products passed down through generations.

Traditional use does not establish that our products are safe or effective for any medical condition. The claims made about traditional uses are based on historical practices and are provided for informational purposes only.

---

## No Medical or Health Claims

**Forestal MT products are not medicines, drugs, or medical treatments.**

Statements regarding botanicals, oils, honey, or other products have not been evaluated by medical or regulatory authorities such as the FDA (United States), EMA (European Union), or equivalent agencies.

**FDA Disclaimer:** These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

Results from using our products may vary from person to person. The experiences shared by customers or described in product descriptions are not guaranteed outcomes. Individual factors including skin type, hair type, diet, overall health, and lifestyle can affect results.

---

## Healthcare Professional Consultation

**We strongly recommend that you consult with a qualified healthcare professional before using any of our products, especially if you:**

- Are pregnant or nursing
- Have any medical conditions (chronic illness, autoimmune disorders, metabolic conditions)
- Are taking prescription medications or supplements
- Are planning to use products on children or elderly individuals
- Have a history of allergies or skin sensitivities
- Are undergoing medical treatment or have recently had surgery

Your healthcare provider can advise you on potential interactions, contraindications, or risks specific to your individual health situation.

## Product Safety and Allergy Information

Our products contain natural ingredients that may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.

### Before First Use

**Patch Test Recommended:**

1. Apply a small amount of product to a discrete area of skin (inner forearm or behind ear)
2. Wait 24-48 hours to check for any reaction
3. If you experience redness, itching, swelling, or irritation, do not use the product

**Read Ingredient Lists Carefully:**

Review the complete ingredient list for any known allergens before purchase or use.

**Common potential allergens in our products include:**

- Palm-derived oils (Batana Oil from _Elaeis oleifera_)
- Bee products (stingless bee honey)
- Various botanical ingredients (herbs, plant extracts, essential oils)

### If an Adverse Reaction Occurs

**Discontinue use immediately if you experience:**

- Skin irritation, redness, itching, or rash
- Swelling or hives
- Difficulty breathing or respiratory distress
- Any other unusual symptoms

**Seek medical attention if:**

- Symptoms are severe or persistent
- You experience signs of anaphylaxis (difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, dizziness)
- Symptoms worsen after discontinuing use

### External Use Guidelines

Unless specifically indicated otherwise on product labeling:

- **Topical products are for external use only**
- Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes
- In case of accidental eye contact, rinse thoroughly with water and seek medical attention if irritation persists
- In case of accidental ingestion, contact a poison control center or seek immediate medical attention

**Traditional Herbs:** Some herbs are traditionally prepared for internal consumption (teas, infusions). Follow preparation instructions carefully and consult healthcare professionals for guidance on internal use.

**Stingless Bee Honey:** Intended for consumption and traditional topical applications. Not recommended for infants under 12 months old (standard honey safety guideline).

---

## Product Variability

Due to the natural and traditional nature of our products, **variations in color, aroma, texture, and appearance may occur between batches**.

Such variations are inherent to:

- Wildcrafted and forest-harvested materials
- Artisanal and traditional processing methods
- Origin-sourced products from specific ecosystems
- Seasonal and environmental factors affecting plant chemistry

**These variations do not constitute defects** and reflect the authentic, unrefined nature of our ethnobotanical products.

---

## Storage and Handling

For product safety, quality preservation, and maximum shelf life:

### General Storage Guidelines

- Store products in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight
- Keep containers tightly sealed when not in use
- Avoid exposure to excessive heat or humidity
- Keep out of reach of children and pets
- Do not use products past their recommended shelf life or expiration date

### Product-Specific Storage

- **Batana Oil:** Store at room temperature. May solidify in cool conditions — this is normal behavior and does not affect quality.
- **Stingless Bee Honey:** Keep sealed in an airtight container. Higher moisture content than common honey makes proper sealing essential.
- **Traditional Herbs:** Store in airtight containers in a dry environment. Avoid moisture contamination to preserve potency.

### Contamination Prevention

- Do not introduce water or foreign substances into product containers
- Use clean, dry hands or utensils when handling products
- Discard products that show signs of contamination (mold, unusual odor, discoloration)
