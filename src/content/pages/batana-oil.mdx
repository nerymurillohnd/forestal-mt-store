## The Batana Oil Collection

For generations, the Miskito people of La Mosquitia, Honduras, have been known for their striking, healthy hair. Their secret lives in the rainforest — in the fruit of the American Palm (_Elaeis oleifera_), transformed into a deeply restorative oil through techniques handed down within families and communities for as long as anyone can remember.

Forestal MT's Batana Oil Collection brings that tradition to you. Every batch begins with wild-harvested palm nuts gathered from thriving forest stands by Miskito harvesters who know these trees intimately. From harvest to finished product, we protect what makes this oil extraordinary: a true place, a true practice, and a true origin you can trace.

---

## A Tradition Worth Knowing

Batana Oil is more than an ingredient. It is a heritage carried forward — born from an intimate understanding of the rainforest, the rhythm of the palms, and the skilled hands of communities who have worked this craft for generations.

We collaborate directly with Miskito harvesters who continue these sustainable wild-harvesting practices. No anonymous supply chains. No guesswork about where your oil comes from. Just transparent documentation and responsible sourcing you can trust.

- **Origin:** La Mosquitia rainforest, Honduras
- **Source:** American oil palm (_Elaeis oleifera_)
- **Heritage:** Miskito indigenous tradition
- **Traditional uses:** Hair restoration, skin nourishment, beard care

---

## Two Ways to Make It, Both Honored at Origin

### Traditional Miskito Processing

The ancestral method. Slow heat and natural separation produce a warm, aromatic oil with the deep restorative character the Miskito have valued for generations. This is Batana Oil in its most culturally authentic form.

### Cold-Pressed Extraction

A modern, solvent-free approach that preserves the oil's natural nutrients while delivering a clean, consistent profile — ideal for cosmetic and wellness formulations that demand precision.

Forestal MT offers both methods, giving you the choice between heritage-driven craftsmanship and refined purity. Each comes with authentic origin and full traceability.
