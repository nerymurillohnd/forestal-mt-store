## 41 Wildcrafted Varieties from Honduran Landscapes

A living archive of ethnobotanical wisdom accumulated across millennia by indigenous cultures of Central America and the Caribbean — preserved through wildcrafted, shade-dried plants sourced directly from the landscapes where they have always grown.

---

## The Traditional Herbs Collection

Honduras sits at a unique ecological crossroads between North America, South America, and the Caribbean. Cloud forests, tropical lowlands, river corridors, and coastal ecosystems converge here to create extraordinary botanical diversity. The plants that grow in these landscapes — native and long-naturalized — have never been treated as commodities. They are integral to cultural identity, daily life, and ancestral practice.

Forestal MT's Traditional Herbs Collection reflects the wisdom of healers, midwives, herbalists, and indigenous knowledge keepers who have stewarded this botanical understanding for centuries. Every herb is gathered from native ecosystems where it has been recognized and respected for generations:

- Cultural and ceremonial significance
- Household and community applications
- Ancestral knowledge systems
- Nutritional and wellness traditions

We bridge this deep-rooted heritage with modern demand — offering wildcrafted, shade-dried herbs sourced directly from origin landscapes and communities. Never commoditized. Never disconnected from place.

---

## Rooted in Place and Practice

Our sourcing model prioritizes what matters:

- **Origin authenticity:** Every herb carries a verifiable connection to its native ecosystem
- **Cultural continuity:** Working with communities who maintain traditional knowledge
- **Ecological balance:** Sustainable harvesting that protects biodiversity
- **Transparent documentation:** Full traceability from harvest site to delivery

By working directly with local harvesters in Olancho and La Mosquitia, we help preserve both botanical diversity and the cultural heritage that has protected it for generations.

- **Origin:** Olancho and La Mosquitia, Honduras
- **Source:** Native and long-naturalized medicinal plants
- **Heritage:** Indigenous and mestizo ethnobotanical traditions
- **Character:** Hand-picked at peak maturity, shade-dried to preserve natural properties

---

## How We Work: Wildcrafted and Shade-Dried

Each herb follows a careful, origin-grounded process designed to maintain its natural character while respecting the ecosystems it comes from.

### Gathered From Where They Grow

Every plant is collected in its natural habitat — no farms, no synthetic inputs. Sourced from biodiverse regions aligned with ancestral gathering sites, by people who know these plants by name, season, and place.

### Harvested With Care

- Handpicked at the right stage of maturity, often in early morning after the dew has dried
- Only abundant species collected; root systems preserved when possible
- Harvest sites rotated to maintain ecosystem health
- Only a small portion of any plant population is taken

### From Harvest to Storage

**Sorting and cleaning:** As herbs are picked, unwanted debris — dirt, dead leaves, other plant matter — is removed by hand. Plants are sorted by type, and sturdier stems are separated from delicate leaves and flowers.

**Bundling or spreading:** Delicate herbs with stems are tied in small, loose bundles and hung upside down. Roots, bark, and loose leaves are spread in a single thin layer on ventilated drying beds. This supports consistent airflow around each piece.

**Natural shade drying:** Bundles and beds are placed in cool, dry, well-ventilated spaces protected from direct sunlight, strong wind, and pests. This slow, indirect drying prevents the breakdown of heat-sensitive volatile oils — preserving aroma, color, and the herbs' botanical profile.

**Final processing and storage:** Once fully dry and brittle, herbs are taken down and any remaining stems or debris removed. Dried botanicals are stored in airtight containers away from light and moisture. Leaves are kept whole until use to help preserve their natural volatile compounds.
