## Who We Are

Forestal Murillo Tejada S. de R.L. (Forestal MT) is a 100% family-owned Honduran ethnobotanical exporter based in San Francisco de la Paz, Olancho.

Our business model reflects long-term resilience through **diversified operations** including international exports, real estate development, local commerce, agriculture, and livestock. This integrated approach supports sustainable growth while maintaining our core commitment to ethnobotanical excellence.

## Mission, Vision, and Promise

### Mission

To preserve and ethically share Honduras' ancestral ethnobotanical wisdom through pure, artisanal products that sustain ecosystems, honor indigenous knowledge holders, and serve wellness markets worldwide.

### Vision

To become the world's most trusted source for Honduran ethnobotanical treasures, setting the global benchmark for authenticity, traceability, and responsible trade.

### Our Promise

**Heritage you can verify. Quality you can measure. Sourcing you can trust.**

---

## What Sets Us Apart

**Forestal MT is not a middleman. We are the source.**

Most suppliers resell from unknown origins. We source directly from indigenous communities in Honduras who craft these products using ancestral methods. No brokers. No traders. No intermediaries.

You get Batana Oil from _Elaeis oleifera_ palms in La Mosquitia, Jimerito honey from ancestral log hives, and wildcrafted herbs from native territories — with **full traceability from forest to your door**.

We ship worldwide, build long-term partnerships, and deliver origin-crafted products with consistent quality. When you grow, we grow.

**The difference is control, authenticity, and trust** — from people who know the forest, the harvesters, and every step of the process.

## Our Story

Our story begins in the forests of Olancho.

In the **1990s**, Nery Roberto Murillo Montalvan began working the land and caring for thousands of hectares as a responsibility to future generations. That care became a way of life, and in **2009** it became a company: **Forestal Murillo Tejada S. de R.L.**

The early years focused on responsible forestry and pine resin exports, building discipline in land management, logistics, and compliance. In **2018**, during a pine resin project in La Mosquitia, Miskito community leaders gifted us two bottles of traditional Batana Oil. That moment revealed a new path rooted in ancestral knowledge and origin-crafted botanicals.

In **2020**, the family renewed the company's direction and fully embraced ethnobotanicals. Today, Forestal MT serves global partners while protecting the integrity of the forest, the people who harvest with care, and the traditions that make these products possible.

## Our History — From Forest Stewardship to Global Ambassador

### 1. Origins in Stewardship (1990–2000)

Forestal MT's beginnings trace back to the **early 1990s**, when **Nery Roberto Murillo Montalván** entered the lumber industry with a long-term vision of responsible land management. Over the decade, he acquired and cared for **more than 5,000 hectares of woodland** in Olancho.

These forests were treated as a generational responsibility, forming the philosophical and ecological foundation of the enterprise.

### 2. Formal Foundation (2009)

In **2009**, stewardship became institutional with the creation of **Forestal Murillo Tejada S. de R.L.**

The company's operations centered on:

- Responsible timber extraction
- Pine resin production and exports
- Regeneration-focused forest management

This phase built the operational discipline and market understanding that later supported expansion into ethnobotanicals and other business activities.

### 3. A Turning Point in La Mosquitia (2018)

In **2018**, while working with Miskito territorial councils in **La Mosquitia** on a pine resin initiative, community leaders gifted the company **two bottles of Batana Oil**. The gesture carried deep cultural significance.

Shortly afterward, the Honduran government suspended all forest management plans (_Planes de Manejo Forestal_) in the region, ending resin operations. The Batana Oil samples, however, revealed a new path that honored ancestral craftsmanship and aligned with emerging global wellness markets.

This moment became the catalyst for Forestal MT's transition into ethnobotany.

### 4. Family-Led Renewal (2020)

During the global uncertainty of **2020**, Forestal MT reorganized as a **consensus-led, family-owned enterprise**, maintaining full ownership within the Murillo Tejada family.

The company reaffirmed its core purpose:

- Honor tradition
- Innovate responsibly
- Protect culture and landscape

This became the foundation for the company's evolution beyond forestry.

### 5. Expansion into Ethnobotanicals

With renewed clarity of mission, Forestal MT expanded into **three curated botanical collections**, each rooted in Honduras' ancestral heritage:

- **Batana Oil** — Wild-harvested _Elaeis oleifera_ from La Mosquitia
- **Stingless Bee Honey** — Traditional Jimerito from native forests
- **Traditional Herbs** — Wildcrafted botanicals from cloud forests and coastal regions

These collections bridge indigenous territories, traditional harvesters, and biodiverse Honduran landscapes to global partners seeking authenticity and traceability.

### 6. Strategic Diversification

Alongside its core ethnobotanical and forestry operations, Forestal MT maintains **complementary business activities** that strengthen long-term resilience and regional impact:

- **Real estate development** — Strategic land management and property development
- **Livestock operations** — Sustainable ranching practices
- **Strategic investments** — Portfolio diversification for generational wealth
- **Local commerce** — Supporting regional economic development

These adjacent activities form a diversified ecosystem that supports the company's foundational mission while contributing to economic development within its communities.

### 7. Present Day — Global Ambassador of Honduran Heritage

What began as a single bottle of Batana Oil has grown into a **multi-collection export enterprise** serving partners across:

- North America
- Central and South America
- Europe
- Asia

Through continued growth, Forestal MT preserves a transparent forest-to-customer chain and remains committed to safeguarding ancestral knowledge, ecological integrity, and sustainable rural livelihoods.

**Timeline Highlights:**

- **2023:** Global expansion serving customers worldwide, bringing Honduran traditions to international markets
- **2024:** B2B growth with partnerships including Fortune 500 companies (Dabur International as key client)
- **2025:** Digital expansion with comprehensive e-commerce platform serving both B2C and B2B customers directly

### Evolution with Purpose

Forestal MT's journey reflects:

- Long-term environmental stewardship
- Community-based partnerships
- Adaptation to regulatory and market shifts
- Deep respect for cultural and ecological origin stories
- Strategic diversification that reinforces resilience

This evolution positions Forestal MT as a custodian of Honduras' natural heritage and a global ambassador of its living botanical traditions.
