            The CI build just failed. Read the CLAUDE.md for project context.
            Analyze the failed job logs, identify the root cause, and fix it.
            Rules:
            - Run `pnpm install && pnpm build` to reproduce locally
            - Fix the issue with minimal changes
            - Do NOT add features or refactor — only fix the build
            - Create a PR with the fix if you can resolve it
            - If you cannot fix it, open an issue describing the root cause
